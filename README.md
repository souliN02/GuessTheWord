# Guess The Word Game

## About

This is a fun and easy game that I created as a Python learning project. It involves two players: one who chooses a secret word and another who tries to guess it using the command-line interface.
 

## How to Play

1. Player 1 enters a secret word.
2. Player 2 guesses one letter at a time.
3. If Player 2 guesses a letter correctly, it is revealed in the word.
4. If Player 2 guesses incorrectly, they lose one of their six lives.
5. The game continues until Player 2 has guessed the word or run out of lives.

## Running the Game

To run the game, simply execute the `GuessTheWord.py` script in Python.

```bash
python GuessTheWord.py
